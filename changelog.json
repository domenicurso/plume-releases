        "Added a capability-based plugin permissions panel that explains, in plain language, what each plugin can access or modify before you trust it",
        "Reworked Settings > Plugins to show real official plugin entries with live enable toggles and one-click access to plugin-specific settings",

        "Migrated official extensions to the v2 defineExtension path with centralized extension compilation and manifest-driven metadata/settings handling",
